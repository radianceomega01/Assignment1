ExecutorService
The Java ExecutorService is the interface which allows us to execute tasks on threads asynchronously. The Java ExecutorService interface is present in the java.util.concurrent package. The ExecutorService helps in maintaining a pool of threads and assigns them tasks. It also provides the facility to queue up tasks until there is a free thread available if the number of tasks is more than the threads available.

void shutdown()
Initiates an orderly shutdown in which previously submitted tasks are executed, but no new tasks will be accepted. Invocation has no additional effect if already shut down.

submit
<T> Future<T> submit(Callable<T> task)
Submits a value-returning task for execution and returns a Future representing the pending results of the task. The Future's get method will return the task's result upon successful completion.

invokeAll
<T> List<Future<T>> invokeAll(Collection<? extends Callable<T>> tasks)
                       throws InterruptedException
Executes the given tasks, returning a list of Futures holding their status and results when all complete. Future.isDone() is true for each element of the returned list. Note that a completed task could have terminated either normally or by throwing an exception. The results of this method are undefined if the given collection is modified while this operation is in progress.
